An item can be in this list, if and only if it has actually missed me in practice
at least on one occasion. Every item must have a 'why', and must not be speculation.

Performance monitoring
----------------------

- _What_: FPS (sensitive to monitor refresh rate)
  _Why_: performance monitoring in the browser

- _What_: Render time
  _Why_: accurate performance tuning in the browser and comparison with native

- _What_: Draw calls count
  _Why_: performance comparison and tuning when batching draw calls

Audio
-----

- _What_: Looping sounds (but how to avoid statefullness from the game point of view?)
  _Why_: the metroid-map-like periodic bleeping sound for oxygen refill in Monoid Unrest.
  At the moment, must be emulated in game code, leading to a slightly (but audible) irregular period,
  and requiring the game code to know the period time value.

- _What_: Positionnal audio
  _Why_: for the heaters in pyyrolysis. It's unrealistic to have the full volume if the sound is emitted by a far away object.

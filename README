Description
-----------

This is a demo of a platform independent C++11 game project.
It uses SDL, SDL_mixer, and the OpenGL core profile.
It's meant as an example of a real-time game which can be compiled to native
code, or, using Emscripten, to Javascript, and maybe one day to WebAssembly.

The code doesn't contain any reference/dependency to Emscripten, except in the
main file, where the main loop function gets passed to Emscripten.

This code also shows how to isolate your game logic code (entities, bullets)
from your I/O code (display, audio).

Directory structure
-------------------

bin:        output directory for binaries.
./check:    main check script. Call this to build native and asmjs versions.
src/engine: I/O code (game-agnostic)
src/game:   game logic
src/base:   utilities shared between game logic and I/O code ; scene declaration
res:        game resources (sounds, pictures)


Build
-----

Requirements:
* libsdl1.2-dev
* libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
* libsdl-image1.2-dev

It can be compiled to native code using your native compiler (gcc or clang):

$ make

It can also be compiled to Javascript, using Emscripten.

$ CXX=emcc make

See how the ./check script does for more information.

Description
-----------

This is a demo of a platform independent C++11 game project.
It uses SDL, SDL_mixer, OpenGL core profile.
It's meant as an example of a real-time game which can be compiled to native,
or to Javascript (using Emscripten), and maybe one day to WebAssembly.

The code doesn't contain any reference to Emscripten, except in the main file.

This code also shows how to isolate your game logic code (entities, bullets)
from your I/O code (display, audio).

Directory structure
-------------------

bin:        output directory for binaries.
./check:    main check script. Call this to build native and asmjs versions.
src/engine: I/O code (game-agnostic)
src/game:   game logic
res:        game resources (sounds, pictures)


Build
-----

It can be compiled to native code using gcc:

$ make

If you want to compile it to Javascript with Emscripten:

$ CXX=emcc make

Description
-----------

This is a demo of a platform-independent C++14 game project.
It uses SDL2, SDL2_image, and the OpenGL core profile.

It's meant as an example of a platformer/metroidvania game
which can be compiled to native code, or, using Emscripten, to Javascript,
and maybe one day to WebAssembly.

The code doesn't contain any reference/dependency to Emscripten, except in the
entry-point file, where the main loop function gets passed to Emscripten.

This code also shows how to isolate your game logic code (doors, switches,
powerups, bullets, ..) from your I/O code (display, audio, input).

Directory structure
-------------------

bin:        output directory for binaries.
./check:    main check script. Call this to build native and asmjs versions.
src/engine: I/O code (game-agnostic)
src/game:   game logic (engine-agnostic)
src/base:   utilities shared between game logic and I/O code ; scene declaration
res:        game resources (sounds, sprites, tiles)
res-src:    "source code" for assets


Build
-----

Requirements:
* libsdl1.2-dev
* libsdl-image1.2-dev
* libogg-dev
* libvorbis-dev

It can be compiled to native code using your native compiler (gcc or clang):

$ make

The binaries will be generated to a 'bin' directory (This can be overriden
using the BIN makefile variable).

It can also be compiled to Javascript, using Emscripten.
In theory, it's as simple as:

$ CXX=emcc make

However, in practise, more options need to be injected to the makefile.
See how the ./check script works for more information about this.

Run the game
------------

Just run the following command:

$ bin/rel/deeep.exe
